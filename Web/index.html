			<h2>About Us</h2>
			<p> The Brentwood Lemelson MIT InvenTeam has recieved the L-MIT $10,000 grant, a STEM based competition for
				pursuing young inventors (link: <a href="https://lemelson.mit.edu/inventeams"
					target="_blank">https://lemelson.mit.edu/inventeams</a>). The InvenTeam consists of 11 members in
				different sections: engineering/design, research, and finance/engagement. The project pitched to the
				annual
				Lemelson-MIT Competition was a Multi Unit Sensor for Climate and Ecological monitoring (M.U.S.C.L.E);

			<h2>M.U.S.C.L.E</h2>
			<p> The M.U.S.C.L.E is a cost effective, user friendly, water monitoring system that can be easily
				accessible
				and used by the general public. Its job is to measure environmental conditions: temperature, pH levels,
				salinity, and a muscle gaping sensor that the team is developing. The idea revolves around salt marshes,
				creating efficiency to the Atlantic coast Geukensia demissa (ribbed mussels). </p>

			<h2>Importance Of The M.U.S.C.L.E</h2>
			<p> Salt marshes are coastal wetlands which yield important ecological services to neighboring coastal
				ecosystems like, preventing wave energy/storm surges. They are vital for protecting shorelines, acting
				as a
				natural barrier from preventing erosion, and filtering runoff from excess nutrients which cause nitrogen
				loading. However, due to climate change driven sea level rise, and eutrophication, salt marshes are
				degrading. To restrict progressive destruction from our salt marshes, monitoring environmental factors
				can
				help us understand the marsh more and create faster alternatives to preventing environmental damage.

			<h2>The Schematics</h2>
			<p> The invention prioritizes Arduino board in a custom 3D printed waterproof-casing; it utilizes ribbed
				mussels
				to track the changing environment through monitoring the gape of the shell, or the angle of how much the
				mussel opens. </p>
		</section>
		<section class="text-section">
			<h2>Last Words</h2>
			<p> Prior research was done in the lab, determining that mussels gape less when stressed, caused by lack of
				food, nearby predators, and certain environmental factors or change. Ribbed mussel biosensor will
				indicate
				negative or positive changes in the enviornment. The team aims to target an audience to people who want
				to
				contribute in our community as well as pursuing environmental scientists that lack equipment. For any
				contact information, please contact us at <a

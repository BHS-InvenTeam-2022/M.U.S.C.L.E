		<h2>About Us</h2>
		<p> The Brentwood Lemelson MIT InvenTeam has recieved the L-MIT $10,000 grant, a STEM based competition for
			pursuing young inventors (link: <a href="https://lemelson.mit.edu/inventeams"
				target="_blank">https://lemelson.mit.edu/inventeams</a>). The InvenTeam consists of 11 members in
			different sections: engineering/design, research, and finance/engagement. The project pitched to the annual
			Lemelson-MIT Competition was a Multi Unit Sensor for Climate and Ecological monitoring (M.U.S.C.L.E); Link:

		<h2>M.U.S.C.L.E</h2>
		<p> The M.U.S.C.L.E is a cost effective, user friendly, water monitoring system that can be easily accessible
			and used by the general public. Its job is to measure environmental conditions: temperature, pH levels,
			salinity, and a muscle gaping sensor that the team is developing. The idea revolves around salt marshes,
			creating efficiency to the Atlantic coast Geukensia demissa (ribbed mussels). </p>

		<h2>Importance Of The M.U.S.C.L.E</h2>
		<p> Salt marshes are coastal wetlands which yield important ecological services to neighboring coastal
			ecosystems like, preventing wave energy/storm surges. They are vital for protecting shorelines, acting as a
			natural barrier from preventing erosion, and filtering runoff from excess nutrients which cause nitrogen
			loading. However, due to climate change driven sea level rise, and eutrophication, salt marshes are
			degrading. To restrict progressive destruction from our salt marshes, monitoring environmental factors can
			help us understand the marsh more and create faster alternatives to preventing environmental damage. </p>

		<h2>The Schematics</h2>
		<p> The invention prioritizes Arduino board in a custom 3D printed waterproof-casing; it utilizes ribbed mussels
			to track the changing environment through monitoring the gape of the shell, or the angle of how much the
			mussel opens. </p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h2>Last Words</h2>
		<p> Prior research was done in the lab, determining that mussels gape less when stressed, caused by lack of
			food, nearby predators, and certain environmental factors or change. Ribbed mussel biosensor will indicate
			negative or positive changes in the enviornment. The team aims to target an audience to people who want to
			contribute in our community as well as pursuing environmental scientists that lack equipment. For any
			contact information, please contact us at <a
